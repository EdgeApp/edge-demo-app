# Introduction

The Edge SDK provides an out-of-box solution for non-custodial wallet management that works with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) applications.  

We recommend developers to treat each step of this guide as a commit when integrating the Edge SDK. This would improve the readability of your commit history and make it easier to fix/experiment with things as there's no dependencies between any two commits. 

Feel free to explore and/or fork the [demo app repository](https://github.com/EdgeApp/edge-demo-app). We welcome any feedback or questions that you may have during the integration process. Submit a ticket [here](https://edgeapp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
